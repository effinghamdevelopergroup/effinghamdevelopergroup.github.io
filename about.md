The founders Joey Meyer and Ryan Condron attended several developer meet ups in
St. Louis. With the lack of an environment to interact with other developers
outside of work and the size the developer community in the Effingham
Area they felt a meet up in Effingham would do well. The group is still in the
early stages and hopes to provide a fun environment outside of work to interact
with other developers in the area.

The goals of the group are:
- Learn for each other, as our backgrounds and expertise differ
- Mentor junior developers and new developers
- Audience to practice with, before conference talks
- Hack on pet (personal) projects
